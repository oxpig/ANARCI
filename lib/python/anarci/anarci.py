ANARCI - Antigen Receptor Numbering And ClassIfication

Oxford Protein Informatics Group (OPIG). 2015-17

ANARCI performs alignments of sequences to databases of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).
Those that align with a significant score are classified by species and chain type.
They are then numbered with a scheme of the user's choosing. 

Currently implemented schemes: 
    IMGT
    Chothia (IGs only)
    Kabat (IGs only)
    Martin / Enhanced Chothia (IGs only)
    AHo 
    Wolfguy (IGs only)

Currently recognisable species (chains):
    Human (heavy, kappa, lambda, alpha, beta)
    Mouse (heavy, kappa, lambda, alpha, beta)
    Rat (heavy, kappa, lambda)
    Rabbit (heavy, kappa, lambda)
    Pig (heavy, kappa, lambda)
    Rhesus Monkey (heavy, kappa)
    
Notes:
 o Use assign_germline to get a better species assignment
 o Each scheme has been implemented to follow the published specification as closely as possible. However, in places some schemes
   do not specifiy where insertions should be placed (e.g. imgt FW3). In these cases the HMM alignment is used. This can give rise
   to inserted positions that were not described by the respective paper. 
 o AHo is implemented heuristically based on chain type. If one grafted a foreign CDR1 loop onto, say, a VH domain, it will be 
   numbered as if it is a CDRH1 loop.

    The main function for anarci. Identify antibody and TCR domains, number them and annotate their germline and species. 

    It is advised to use one of the wrapper functions:
        o run_anarci   - fasta file or sequence list in. Automated multiprocessing for large jobs. Sequences, numbering, details 
                         and hit tables out. 
        o number       - single sequence in, numbering out

    
    @param sequences: A list or tuple of (Id, Sequence) pairs
                              e.g. [ ("seq1","EVQLQQSGAEVVRSG ..."),
                                     ("seq2","DIVMTQSQKFMSTSV ...") ]
    @param scheme:    The numbering scheme that should be applied. Choose from imgt, chothia, kabat or martin
    @param output:    Boolean flag to say whether the result should be output.
    @param outfile:   The name of the file to output to. If output is True and outfile is None then output is printed
                      to stdout.
    @param csv:       Boolean flag to say whether the csv output alignment format or the vertical anarci format should be used.
    @param allow:     A set containing the chain types that should be recognised. If chothia, kabat or martin is used
                      as the scheme, anarci will ignore tcr chains. Choose a subset of ["H","K","L","A","B","G","D"]
    @param assign_germline: Using highest sequence identity assign the germline to the chain. Can be more accurate at identifying
                      species than the best HMM hit alone. (Bool)
    @param allowed_species: If assign_germline is true, limit the species that can be assigned to a limited set. Useful when the 
                      animal species is known or when performing closest germline experiments. Choose a subset of ['human',
                      'mouse','rat','rabbit','rhesus','pig','alpaca'].


    @param bit_score_threshold: The threshold score from HMMER at which an alignment should be numbered. Lowering the threshold 
                      means domain recognition is more permissive and can be useful for numbering heavily engineered molecules. 
                      However, too low and false positive recognition of other ig-like molecules will occur.
    @param hmmerpath: The path to hmmscan. If left unspecified then the PATH will be searched. 
    @param ncpu:      The number of cpu's that hmmer should be allowed to use. If not specified then the hmmscan 
                      default is used. N.B. hmmscan must be compiled with multithreading enabled for this option to have effect. 
                      Please consider using the run_anarci function for native multiprocessing with anarci.
    @param database:  The HMMER database that should be used. Normally not changed unless a custom db is created.
    @param hmm_path:  The path to the hmm data files. Default (None) will be set to use the default HMM_path


    @return: Three lists. Numbered, Alignment_details and Hit_tables.
             Each list is in the same order as the input sequences list.
             A description of each entry in the three lists is as followed.

                           numbering, start and finish indices.
               o Alignment_details: will be None if no domain was found for that sequence or a dictionary for each
                           domain identified containing the details of the alignment (chain type, e-value, species etc).
               o Hit_tables: None if no domain was found for that sequence or a nested list for each domain containing
                           the hit table from hmmscan.

def run_anarci( seq, ncpu=1, **kwargs):
    '''
    Run the anarci numbering protocol for single or multiple sequences.
    
    @param sequences: A list or tuple of (Id, Sequence) pairs
                              e.g. [ ("seq1","EVQLQQSGAEVVRSG ..."),
                                     ("seq2","DIVMTQSQKFMSTSV ...") ]
    @param scheme:    The numbering scheme that should be applied. Choose from imgt, chothia, kabat or martin
    @param output:    Boolean flag to say whether the result should be output.
    @param outfile:   The name of the file to output to. If output is True and outfile is None then output is printed
                      to stdout.
    @param allow:     A set containing the chain types that should be recognised. If chothia, kabat or martin is used
                      as the scheme, anarci will ignore tcr chains. Choose a subset of ["H","K","L","A","B","G","D"]
    @param assign_germline: Using highest sequence identity assign the germline to the chain. Can be more accurate at identifying
                      species than the best HMM hit alone. (Bool)
    @param allowed_species: If assign_germline is true, limit the species that can be assigned to a limited set. Useful when the 
                      animal species is known or when performing closest germline experiments. Choose a subset of ['human',
                      'mouse','rat','rabbit','rhesus','pig','alpaca'].

    @param bit_score_threshold: The threshold score from HMMER at which an alignment should be numbered. Lowering the threshold 
                      means domain recognition is more permissive and can be useful for numbering heavily engineered molecules. 
                      However, too low and false positive recognition of other ig-like molecules will occur.
    @param hmmerpath: The path to hmmscan. If left unspecified then the PATH will be searched. 
    @param ncpu:      The number of cpu's that hmmer should be allowed to use. If not specified then the hmmscan 
                      default is used. N.B. hmmscan must be compiled with multithreading enabled for this option to have effect. 
                      Please consider using the run_anarci function for native multiprocessing with anarci.
    @param database:  The HMMER database that should be used. Normally not changed unless a custom db is created.

    @return: Four lists. Sequences, Numbered, Alignment_details and Hit_tables.
             Each list is in the same order. 
             A description of each entry in the four lists is as followed.
               o Sequences: The list of sequences formatted as [(Id,sequence), ...]. 
               o Numbered: will be None if no domain was found for that sequence or a list of domains with their 
                           numbering, start and finish indices.
               o Alignment_details: will be None if no domain was found for that sequence or a dictionary for each
                           domain identified containing the details of the alignment (chain type, e-value, species etc).
               o Hit_tables: None if no domain was found for that sequence or a nested list for each domain containing
                           the hit table from hmmscan.
