---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Functions are written to a template:

There are 128 match states in the HMMs (these are the IMGT states). The alignment to these states must be converted to
correspond to the scheme of choice. 

We define:
  - a state string consisting of 'X' and 'I' where:
    X  means that for the state there is an equivalent position in the numbering scheme.
    I  means that for the state there is not an equivalent position in the numbering scheme. It should therefore be 
       considered as an insertion in the scheme.
       
  - a region string consisting of characters (integers in the currently implemented schemes). Each character 
corresponds to a contiguous region. Therefore each state can be assigned a region according to the scheme. 

  - a mapping between region characters and region indices as a dictionary. e.g. the first region character maps
to 0, second to 1 ...

  - a dictionary containing the difference between state number (imgt) and scheme number at the *beginning* of 
each region using the region indices as keys and the difference as values.

  - the number of regions defined

  - a list for which delete states should not be included in the numbering (typically those for the cdrs). This
will allow the length of the region to be the number of residues found instead of the number of possible states plus
insertions.

 
This all goes into the _number_regions function along with the sequence and the state_vector (the alignment from the
HMM).

_number regions will then divide the aligned part of the sequence into as many regions as defined above. Within each 
region it will give a numbering according to the input parameters. A list of lists will be returned containing the 
numbered sequence for each region.

Some of the regions will not be numbered correctly according to the scheme. For example the insertions for the CDRs
will not necessarily be on the correct residue. For each different scheme these regions are then modified (see code
for implementation) 

Finally the full numbered sequence is compiled and returned to the calling function.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other schemes can be implemented following the template above.

    '''
    The function aims to correct to the expected imgt alignment. Renumbering functions then translate from the imgt scheme to the
    appropriate scheme.        

    Handle insertions made by HMMER that we suspect may be in the wrong position.
    Edge cases include:
        - Insertions at the C terminal of fw1, fw3 and fw3 regions. Can occur when 'conserved' residues have been mutated and the 
          same amino acid appears in the the following CDR (e.g. mutate cysteine at 104 but the CDR3 has one or more cysteines)
        - Same as above possible (but not observed in structure seqs) for N terminal of fw2, fw3 and fw4... TODO
        - Heavily mutated N terminal regions that are partially recognised (e.g. 3gk8 chain H). Insertions should not be allowed 
          before N terminal deletions have been used. Preserve deletion locations that are not N terminal (e.g. 10 in IMGT H) if 
          the gap has been placed by the alignment.

# The Wolfguy numbering scheme is an in-house scheme used at Roche. It has been described publicly in the paper:
# Prediction of VH-VL domain orientation for antibody variable domain modeling. Bujotzek A. et al. Protein 2015 83(4) 681-95
#
# It is similar in gapping as IMGT and is defined only for heavy and light antibody chains. 
# Unlike other schemes the numbering denotes both the chain (heavy 101-499, light 501-799) and the region (less than -50 framework
# greater than -50 CDR). All CDRs of length less than 50 can be handled without the need for insertion codes. Numbering of the 
# framework behaves similarly to IMGT in that all positions are assumed to be accounted for. Framework insertions are placed by 
# the alignment. 
#
# Numbering of all CDRs is performed symmetrically with the exception of CDRL1. In this case the CDR is numbered according to a 
# pattern specific to the canonical class. This is recognised by length and by sequence similarity to a consensus sequence. If a 
# length has not been observed it is numbered symmetrically.
